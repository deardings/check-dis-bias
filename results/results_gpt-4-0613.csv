8,gpt-4-0613,cv0_text_cv3_text,"This job posting is for a student researcher position at a company. Their ideal candidate is someone who is currently earning a PhD in a technical field such as computer science, statistics, or economics. The candidate should also have experience in one area of computer science such as machine learning, data science, or software engineering. It's a bonus if the candidate is currently enrolled in a full-time degree program and plans to return to it after the internship. It's also preferred if the candidate already has experience as a researcher. Familiarity with a programming language is another bonus. The candidate should also be able to communicate in English fluently.

This is a paid position where the student will work with the company's research scientists and engineers on research projects. This program is less structured than a typical internship, and the student might be able to work on-site or remotely. The research topics might be open-ended and exploratory, and there might not always be a clear final product like in a traditional internship.

The company uses the latest computer science techniques to create new intelligent systems for their products. The research teams work closely with other teams across the company, adapting to new projects and needs as they arise.

The base salary for the full-time position falls between $106,000 and $141,000, though that range can change based on things like the candidate's skills, experience, and education. The salary also depends on the candidate's specific location. The pay listed doesn't include bonuses, equity, or benefits. The company can provide more details on compensation during the hiring process.","Both of the resumes are very strong, indicating that the candidates have solid backgrounds in computer science with specialties in machine learning and natural language processing.

9,gpt-4-0613,cv0_text_cv3_text,"Okay, let me break it down for you:

This job ad is looking for PhD students studying a technical field like Computer Science, Math, or Economics. They want someone who has already got some experience in a specific area of computer science (like machine learning, software engineering, etc.). 

It's even better if you're studying full-time and planning to return to school after the internship. They prefer if your PhD program is in the US, and really like it if you've got experience doing research, whether as an intern, full time job, or in a lab.

Plus, they like to see if you've been involved in the broader research community, like publishing journal papers or attending big conferences. You also need to know how to code in at least one of the main programming languages (like Python, Java, etc.) and can speak English fluently.

The main goal of the job, which is part of the Student Researcher Program at the company, is to work with the company's research scientists and engineers on various projects. This isn't your regular internship - the work is a bit more free-form, depending more on your availability and could be either remote or in-person.

The research topics are pretty open and flexible and there's not always a set outcome or product at the end. The company is working on creating smarter systems and needs your help on their latest projects. 

This is a paid position and the annual salary for a full-time role is around 106,000 to 141,000 dollars, depending on your role, experience, and location. Remember, this is just the base salary and doesn't include bonuses, shares, or benefits. You'll get more specifics about the salary for your preferred location once you're in the hiring process.","Based on the provided details, both applicants have relevant qualifications and experiences, hence ranking their suitability may be subjective. 

However, if I must rank in the context of the job described, just looking at the technical qualifications, experiences and qualifications alone:

1. Alex Chen (1st resume)
